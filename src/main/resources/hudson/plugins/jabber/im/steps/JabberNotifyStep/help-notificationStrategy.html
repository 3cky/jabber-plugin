    This only makes sense if the build result has been set, either because this step is in a catch or finally block
    and the job already failed, or because it was manually set in the DSL
    (eg: <b>currentBuild.result = Result.FAILURE.toString()</b>)
    If it was not set, then only "all" will make sense.
